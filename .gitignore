# pyenv
#   For a library or binary, you should probably not check in the .python-version file.
#   For a specialized environment or a container, you might.
#.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies 
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even 
#   fail to install them. In that case, the lock file should be added to .gitignore.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   poetry.lock
#   .python-version

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm build sets the build-backend to pdm-pep517 which writes to a .pdm-python file
